.ISB (Image Serial Binary) Format
Author: @Henry7611913083

[Intro]

This format is an uncompressed RAW image format similar to BMP
It does not include textual metadata such as EXIF
The data structure is defined as follows:

[ String-ASCII Little-Endian | 3 Bytes | File Signature ]
[ Uint8 | 1 Byte | Version Number ]
[ Uint8 | 1 Byte | number of channels ]
[ Uint8 | 1 Byte | Pixel primitive type ]
[ Uint8 | 1 Byte | number of bits per pixel in a channel ]
[ Uint8 | 1 Byte | The order of the channel ]
[ Uint32 Little-Endian | 4 Bytes | horizontal length ]
[ Uint32 Little-Endian  | 4 Bytes | vertical length ]
 . . . Image RAW

[ Metadata for image parsing ]

And the image parsing required 16 bytes code mapping before each is like this:

File Signature is "ISB" ASCII string
This fixed code and Version Number is used to verify formatting in the decoder

The number of channels is parsed with an integer and read

Pixel data types include unsigned integers, signed integers, and floating points
0x00 = unsigned integer
0x01 = signed integer
0x02 = floating point

The number of bits per pixel in a channel represents the number of bits of integer data in the pixel
for example, uint8 is 8 bits, so it is 8

The order of the channel data is
0x00 = Gray
0x01 = GA
0x02 = RGB
0x03 = BGR
0x04 = RGBA
0x05 = BGRA
0x06 = ARGB
0x07 = ABGR

The channel number integer is the same channel order code twice
but this is for verification purposes, and if the code means RGBA
an error occurs when the channel integer is not 4

why both horizontally and vertically length data exist is
to check if the vertical length does not fit in a rectangular image after parsing horizontally

If it doesn't fit, I'll throw an error

To indicate in uint8 RGBA how to arrange the RAW image pixel data order:
[ uint8 | Red ] [ uint8 | Green ] [ uint8 | Blue ] [ uint8 | Alpha ] [ uint8 | Red ] . . . 

[Outro]

I made this format because I need a format that is a little more research-specific than BMP
and if you don't need text metadata like EXIF and make the uncompressed implementation very simple
it might be preferred to write this format
